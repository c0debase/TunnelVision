# TunnelVision 

TunnelVision is a React Native application bootstrapped with the Expo CLI. The
application runs on both iOS and Android and allows the user to enter a task and the amount of time
allotted to that task. The task will be saved in the task history and marked in green if completed
and in red if cancelled prior to the timer completion. Upon completion the phone vibrates and alerts
the user that their time is up.
